           <p class="section__subtitle section__subtitle--about">Masters Engineer from Vancouver</p>
           
           <div class="about-me__body">
                <p>I am a Masters student studying Smart Electrical Networks and Systems Engineering (SENSE), 
                    with a focus area of batteries and energy storage systems. I am particularly interested in 
                    software and embedded systems. I have two years of work experience, 
                    as a Biomechanical Engineering Research Intern at 
                    <a href="https://humaninmotion.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Human in Motion Robotics</a>,
                     a Product Manager and Developer at <a href="https://www.meaningful.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MeaningfulWork</a>,
                     as a Supplier Quality Engineer at <a href="https://www.ballard.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ballard Power Systems</a>,
                     and as a Test Engineer at <a href="https://www.quantotechltd.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">QuantoTech</a>.</p>   
                <p>For my Masterâ€™s, I embarked on a two-year double degree program in Europe, where I had the opportunity to study 
                    at KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Sweden and Grenoble INP - Ense3 in France. Europe was an ideal choice for my 
                    studies in energy systems because of its progressive policies and ambitious goals for decarbonization and sustainability.
                    Leading the world in renewable energy adoption, energy efficiency, and smart grid development, Europe provided a dynamic 
                    environment to learn from cutting-edge initiatives in sustainable energy. The program also emphasized entrepreneurship, 
                    including a summer business school that condensed essential skills in innovation, market analysis, and startup management. 
                    This combination of technical knowledge and entrepreneurial insight has been invaluable for building a career in clean energy.</p>
                <p>Aside from my studies, I am passionate for student affairs. Currently in my Masters, I am the 
                    <a href="https://community.innoenergy.com/page/student-council-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Year 2 Class representative for SENSE</a>, 
                    as well as the Head of the Executive Committee. I oversee the operations of the student council, and provide leadership and guidance to the team.
                    I also spent four years with the <a href="https://www.msess.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mechatronic Systems Engineering Student Society (MSESS)</a>,
                    where I was elected as President in my final year. In my four years, I helped plan and lead events, reformed our finances, 
                    and led my program through the transition into remote learning during the pandemic, as well as our return to in-person learning. 
                    I facilitated accomodations for students with health issues or other concerns during this time, and also introduced new services to the
                    students to keep us connected during this period of isolation.</p>
               <p>I also enjoy learning to edit videos and creating 3D models, watching movies and TV shows, skiing, playing basketball, 
                magic tricks, and working out in my free time. I have a YouTube channel where I cook AI-generated recipes and try them with my friends.</p>
