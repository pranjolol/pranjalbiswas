                <p>I am a Mechatronics Engineer, with a focus area of software and embedded systems. I have one year total of work experience, as a Biomechanical Engineering Research Intern at <a href="https://humaninmotion.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Human in Motion Robotics</a>, a Product Manager and Developer at <a href="https://www.meaningful.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MeaningfulWork</a>, and as a Supplier Quality Engineer at <a href="https://www.ballard.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ballard Power Systems</a>.</p>   
            <!-- <p>I am an experienced Mechatronics Engineer, with a focus area of software and embedded systems. I have one year total of internship experience in the mechanical and software industry. I worked as a Biomechanical Engineering Research Intern at a start-up called Human in Motion Robotics, where I created a new method to quickly measure and fit users with spinal cord injuries onto an exoskeleton. I used kinematics and physical body segment approximations of the human body, to cut measurement time by 60%.
                I spent four months at MeaningfulWork, a voluntering platform where I worked as a Product Manager and Developer. I worked on the front-end design and back-end of the website, and revamped the account log-in process for volunteers, companies and employees. I also led a team of volunteer developers through some basic front-end development opportunities within the website. As a product manager, I interviewed and surveyed users to determine how to improve our services, and created timelines and  I am currently learning Full-Stack Development and Machine Learning.</p>
               </p> -->
               <p>Aside from my undergraduate studies, I am passionate for student affairs and spent four years with the <a href="https://www.msess.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mechatronic Systems Engineering Student Society (MSESS)</a>, where I was elected as President in my final year. In my four years, I helped plan and lead events, reformed our finances, and led my program through the transition into remote learning during the pandemic, as well as our return to in-person learning. I facilitated accomodations for students with health issues or other concerns during this time, and also introduced new services to the students to keep us connected during this period of isolation.</p>
               <p>I also enjoy learning to edit videos and creating 3D models, watching movies and TV shows, skiing, playing basketball, magic tricks, and working out in my free time. I have a YouTube channel where I cook AI-generated recipes and try them with my friends.</p>
