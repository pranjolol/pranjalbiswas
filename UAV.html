                <p>In MSE 491 - Flight Dynamics & Control of UAVs, I learned and applied basic aircraft aerodynamic principles to create a flight simulator on MATLAB. This was a solo project unlike any other project I had completed in my undergrad,
                    due to the weekly deliverable format and the fact that I was responsible for the entire project from start to finish. I was able to learn a lot about aircraft dynamics and control systems, and I was able to apply this knowledge to create a functional flight simulator.
                </p>
                <!-- <img src="img\projects\capstone-group.jpg" alt=""> -->
                <p>The goal of the project was to understand the various ways that air affects a moving object in 3D space, and I implemented several features to help simulate this.
                    One of the key features of the simulator was a live graph that visualized different aircraft properties such as pitch. This allowed users to see how the aircraft was behaving in real-time and make adjustments as needed. Another important feature was an autopilot system, which was a simple version that worked to maintain trajectory and altitude. The autopilot used control system processes to maintain stability with minimal oscillations and a fast response.
                </p>    
                <p>Overall, the project was a success in that it provided a platform for exploring and understanding the principles of flight and aircraft behavior. It required a solid understanding of aerodynamics and the ability to design and implement a functional simulator using MATLAB.
                    In the future, I plan to continue refining and expanding the capabilities of the flight simulator, possibly by adding more advanced features such as a more sophisticated autopilot or additional aircraft models. I believe this project has the potential to be a valuable tool for those interested in aircraft engineering and simulation, and I am excited to see where it goes in the future.
